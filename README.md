# ArduinoFlightRecorders

This project is to support members interested in developing their own flight computers for high power rocketry. 

The flight computer will be based on the Arduino ecosystem for ease of use. The components to add functionality are selected based on their cost, documentation, and ease of use. 

Current components include:
- Arduino Nano (ATmega328)
- MPU6050 w/breakout board (Inertial measurement unit)
- BMP280 w/breakout board (barometer)
- SD card module

There are currently three stages of this project:
- stage 1 - computer can measure and record flight data
- stage 2 - computer can deploy ejection charges
- stage 3 - computer can transmit telemetry data to a ground station

Currently we are in stage 1
